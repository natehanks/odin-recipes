    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crepe is probably the french word for delicious. Because that's what they are. A thin, French pancake, stuffed with other delicious things.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbs <strong>Butter</strong> (salted or unslated)</li>
        <li>1 Cup <strong>Flour</strong></li>
        <li>1/8 tsp <strong>Salt</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Whole Milk at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Warm Water</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><Strong>Steps</Strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the milk, and put the room temperature milk into a blender. If needed, you can warm the milk briefly in the microwave.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter, and then pour it into the milk.</li>
        <li>Pour the water in next, followed by the salt and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Next add your flour to cover the top of the liqud mixture.</li>
        <li>If you have room temperature eggs, you can now add those too. If not, you'll add the eggs on top of the flour. If they're from the frdige and then added, it will ruin the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Once everything has been added, blend together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook your favorite way, and enjoy with your favorite toppings, except whipped cream. Don't ruin the crepe with that.</li>
    </ol>
